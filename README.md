Laptop
======

Laptop is a script to set up an macOS laptop for web development.

It can be run multiple times on the same machine safely.
It installs, upgrades, or skips packages
based on what is already installed on the machine.

Requirements
------------

We support:

* macOS Mavericks (10.9)
* macOS Yosemite (10.10)
* macOS El Capitan (10.11)
* macOS Sierra (10.12)

Older versions may work but aren't regularly tested. Bug reports for older
versions are welcome.

Install
-------

Download, review, then execute the script:

```sh
curl --remote-name https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brendanwb/laptop/master/mac
less mac
sh mac 2>&1 | tee ~/laptop.log
```

Optionally, [install thoughtbot/dotfiles][dotfiles].

[dotfiles]: https://github.com/thoughtbot/dotfiles#install

Debugging
---------

Your last Laptop run will be saved to `~/laptop.log`.
Read through it to see if you can debug the issue yourself.
If not, copy the lines where the script failed into a
[new GitHub Issue](https://github.com/thoughtbot/laptop/issues/new) for us.
Or, attach the whole log file as an attachment.

Customize in `~/.laptop.local`
------------------------------

Your `~/.laptop.local` is run at the end of the Laptop script.
Put your customizations there.
For example:

```sh
#!/bin/sh

brew bundle --file=- <<EOF
  brew "elixir"
  brew "ansible"
  brew "ffmpeg"
  brew "youtube-dl"
EOF

brew cask install iterm2
brew cask install google-chrome
brew cask install slack
brew cask install Alfred
brew cask install caffeine
brew cask install timer
brew cask install flux
brew cask install whatsapp
brew cask install gpgtools

if [ ! -d "$HOME/wellbe/" ] && [ -f "$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa" ]; then
  fancy_echo "Adding Wellbe Refactor ..."
  git clone git@github.com:Wellbeme/wellbe-refactor.git ~/wellbe/
fi

fancy_echo "Setting up Postgres ..."
ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/postgresql/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.postgresql94.plist
createuser -s -P wellbe

fancy_echo "Setting up Redis ..."
ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/redis/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.redis.plist

fancy_echo "Cleaning up old Homebrew formulae ..."
brew cleanup
brew cask cleanup

fancy_echo "Pulling down dotfiles ..."
if [ ! -d $HOME/dotfiles" ]; then
  git clone git@github.com:brendanwb/dotfiles.git
fi

if [ -r "$HOME/.rcrc" ]; then
  fancy_echo "Updating dotfiles ..."
  rcup
fi
```

Write your customizations such that they can be run safely more than once.
See the `mac` script for examples.

Laptop functions such as `fancy_echo` and
`gem_install_or_update`
can be used in your `~/.laptop.local`.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/thoughtbot/laptop/wiki)
for more customization examples.
